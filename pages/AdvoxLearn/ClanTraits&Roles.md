## Turtle:

**Commons Loop Closing —**

We can think of the Turtle clan as master architects & engineers that hold the blueprints …but in this case the house is on a planetary scale. Key characteristics or functions of Turtles in a system are **_observation & validation_**.

  

Whether in formal decision making or informal organization, Turtles are the ones who observe deliberation between Wolf and Bear and validate whether protocols were followed. In an informal interaction, for example, the Turtle will be the quiet one during a dialogue, waiting until the end to weigh the dialogue against the core values of the system.

  

One step removed from direct facilitation of the other clans, and with a keen engineering eye, Turtles make for the ideal trackers of closed loops of values. So Turtles are tracking the dialogue and sense-making between clans to ensure integrity of the system, to ensure value is circulated to where generators of that value work and live, and to ensure that there is no pure extraction in the system design.

  

So this speaks to the sometimes abstract closed loops of governance protocols or community value circulation. It also includes the tangible closed loops needed in ecological sustainability the world over. Ensuring long term Commons sustainability of many variations is built right into our Stacks Advocates system. Turtles validate that these variations are aligned with core values.

  

## Wolf:

**Commons Accessibility —**

Wolf clan can be thought of as initiators, the constantly moving facilitators of Commons accessibility. The sparks for deliberation of important issues or actions; the guides for empowered paths of information dissemination. Key function being **_to gather the minds and voices of generators of value in consensus_**.

  

In formal decision making protocols it is a Wolf clan representative who initiates processes; bringing issues to the floor. Deliberation, if at all needed, happens between Wolf & Bear clans while the Turtle clan observes before validation or further deliberation. Wolf clan’s informal social organization function revolves around providing direct access to Commons to anybody interested. Whether the Commons of empowered bottom up consensus decision making or the Commons of innovation and value(s) circulation in the Stacks Advocates ecosystem. This empowered accessibility functions as a regenerating catalyst to push ecosystems forward.

  

## Bear:

**Commons Evolution —**

Bear clan is simple, just think of it as effective medicine. Then think of medicine in all its possible forms; even the function of good friendship or guidance. Bears are the masters of transformative potential and effective transition. Key for our Stacks ecosystem, focused on OSS in Can’t Be Evil design & engineering, for a user-empowered internet. Transformation away from conventional models is fundamental for folks coming into our ecosystem, but just as important for our system too.

  

The Bear clan’s key functions are **_ensuring the growth or evolution of complex systems are healthy_**. Bears are responsible for the bridgework away from harmful structures… but they are also responsible for ensuring we don’t move too hastily into paradigm-shifting innovation. Bears are the medicine necessary for slowing down the process of change while doing due diligence to harvest and repurpose institutional leftovers on the careful terms of the community.

  

## The recursion of Turtle, Wolf, & Bear —

Turtle is first in the ordered sequence, with all the elements of Wolf & Bear therein. Wolf & Bear are twins. Wolf coming before Bear in the sequence. This hints at a dynamic use of the three tiered system design rather than static. All three clans have a kind of  “memory” of one another, to be executed when needed in formal or informal social organization. Although one may be Turtle clan officially, in a given interaction, they may be best suited to assume their Wolf or Bear functions too.
