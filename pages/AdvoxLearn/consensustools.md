# Clan Design + Modular Consensus Tools

## Clan Flow: #Active-issues

**Preliminary Consensus**

**0 | Picking up issues**

Female & Male Wolf representatives or the Wolf sub-representatives pick up issues **deemed relevant** in broader Stacks ecosystem or AdvoxDAO. Particularly issues that are picking up steam in dialogue from multiple parties in the channels.

**1 | Autonomous Clan Facilitation**

First, Wolf clan reps tag other clans as needed to tend to the issue. All three clans use the #active-issues channels as needed to deliberate the issue, each using autonomous processes. The bottom up quorum period of participation will need to be decided for consensus; real-time meetings for time zones and schedules will need to be initiated where possible or thread dialogue when not possible.

**2 | Autonomous Clan Prelims**

Two representatives, one female and one male, from each of the 3 clans, come to consensus in autonomous processes before moving to formal consensus, where dialogue will converge. This is critical to sustainability. Through the long term, complex dynamics of our ecosystem, it is ensured that the autonomous voices of women & ecosystems are not drowned out.

Throughout the Preliminary phase, there is communication between the 6 clan reps  (3 female and 3 male). This means the formal phase is virtually just a formalization of what has already been discussed in prelim phase consensus. A critical means for streamlining as many voices as possible while avoiding gridlock.

  

**We currently have no temporary representatives in place, so prelim phase facilitation leads will need to be determined by respective clans until we have selected our reps.**

This is a basic oversimplified use of the #activeissues channel tooling for respective clan consensus. The tooling is to be customized as need to suit the respective clan consensus flows.

**3 | Streamlining the Autonomous Processes in Formal Consensus**

While 9 times out of 10 all positions brought to the floor have already been covered in prelims to easily be made official; this is the first time the female and males are sitting together in decision making. And deliberation is still possible in this formal phase in the rare case it is needed. And here we see a streamlining of autonomous processes, not just between female and male decision making but also between human systems & ecosystems. This is evident in the physical lay out & flow of the formal phase:

  

-   _Male Wolf Clan introduces the issues to the floor. If any needed deliberation, it happens between Bear & Wolf clans, while Turtles observe the deliberation and validate against core collective values, before passing through to be made official._

Both Wolf clans, female and male, sit with their backs to the North. Both Bear clans sit with their backs to the South. But the Female Turtle clan sit with their backs to the West and the Male Turtles with their backs to the East. So while the other clans’ deliberation can occur easily between female & male because they are sitting next to each other, for Turtles to come to consensus on positions there has to be movement across the council floor. And this is a critical mechanism for both social organization resilience & ecological sustainability.

## Formal Consensus: Preservation of Autonomy

Below is a description of how preservation of autonomy in social organization & ecosystems is represented by the Female Turtles walking over to the male Turtles to reach consensus on positions. And how even in this digital space this functions as a critical means to streamlining resilient social consensus in general:

With the [traits of the clans](https://github.com/stx-advox/coc/blob/main/README.md#intro) in full function in decision making, the Turtle’s function here is a last nuance in a long flow of decision making protocols that decouples top down concentrated power, enabling autonomous innovation for generators of value, including our ecosystems.
