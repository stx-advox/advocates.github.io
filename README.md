### What is the Stacks Advocates Program?

The Advocates program is made up of long time community members, passionate contributors to Stacks and newcomers to the ecosystem. Contributors of various backgrounds can make their efforts visible in our Advocates channels right inside the Stacks discord server. Every week we distribute the rewards from a community stacking pool based on the collective evaluation of contributions via [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs). We also have a DAO governance design complete with tooling for decision making right inside our discord server.

### What is the mission?

The mission is to give access to Stacks contributors‚Äô knowledge and to build a healthy environment for community growth where stacks community members at any place in their journey in the web3 space can join and get instant access to connections, knowledge, and support to find where they fit in the ecosystem, people in the advocates community are free to explore where they wanna contribute to the stacks ecosystem and then grow from there into fully capable community contributors applying for community grants and more!

The focus of the Advocates is long term sustainability of innovation and growth in the Stacks ecosystem. Bottom up power distribution is at the heart of our approach to ensuring an accessible space for community growth while maintaining the integrity of a user empowering web3 ecosystem. We aim to provide a unique commons distribution model for decentralized incentive design, bringing longterm horizontal up-skilling networks & innovation to the foreground.
