### What is the Stacks Advocates Program?

The Advocates program is made up of long time community members, passionate contributors to Stacks and newcomers to the ecosystem. Contributors of various backgrounds can make their efforts visible in our Advocates channels right inside the Stacks discord server. Every week we distribute the rewards from a community stacking pool based on the collective evaluation of contributions via [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs). We also have a DAO governance design complete with tooling for decision making right inside our discord server.

### What is the mission?

The mission is to give access to Stacks contributors‚Äô knowledge and to build a healthy environment for community growth where stacks community members at any place in their journey in the web3 space can join and get instant access to connections, knowledge, and support to find where they fit in the ecosystem, people in the advocates community are free to explore where they wanna contribute to the stacks ecosystem and then grow from there into fully capable community contributors applying for community grants and more!

The focus of the Advocates is long term sustainability of innovation and growth in the Stacks ecosystem. Bottom up power distribution is at the heart of our approach to ensuring an accessible space for community growth while maintaining the integrity of a user empowering web3 ecosystem. We aim to provide a unique commons distribution model for decentralized incentive design, bringing longterm horizontal up-skilling networks & innovation to the foreground.

### Who is it for?

The Advocates program is made up of long time community members, passionate contributors to Stacks and newcomers to the ecosystem looking to find what they‚Äôre most passionate about in the ecosystem.

### [Clan Traits & Roles](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/pages/AdvoxLearn/ClanTraits%26Roles.md)
![DaDa clans.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/DaDa%20clans.jpg)
## Turtle:

**Commons Loop Closing ‚Äî**

We can think of the Turtle clan as master architects & engineers that hold the blueprints ‚Ä¶but in this case the house is on a planetary scale. Key characteristics or functions of Turtles in a system are **_observation & validation_**.

  

Whether in formal decision making or informal organization, Turtles are the ones who observe deliberation between Wolf and Bear and validate whether protocols were followed. In an informal interaction, for example, the Turtle will be the quiet one during a dialogue, waiting until the end to weigh the dialogue against the core values of the system.

  

One step removed from direct facilitation of the other clans, and with a keen engineering eye, Turtles make for the ideal trackers of closed loops of values. So Turtles are tracking the dialogue and sense-making between clans to ensure integrity of the system, to ensure value is circulated to where generators of that value work and live, and to ensure that there is no pure extraction in the system design.

  

So this speaks to the sometimes abstract closed loops of governance protocols or community value circulation. It also includes the tangible closed loops needed in ecological sustainability the world over. Ensuring long term Commons sustainability of many variations is built right into our Stacks Advocates system. Turtles validate that these variations are aligned with core values.

  

## Wolf:

**Commons Accessibility ‚Äî**

Wolf clan can be thought of as initiators, the constantly moving facilitators of Commons accessibility. The sparks for deliberation of important issues or actions; the guides for empowered paths of information dissemination. Key function being **_to gather the minds and voices of generators of value in consensus_**.

# Clan Design + Modular Consensus Tools
![clantools.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/clantools.jpg)

## Clan Flow: #Active-issues

use of the #active-issues channel

**Preliminary Consensus**

**0 | Picking up issues**

Female & Male Wolf representatives or the Wolf sub-representatives pick up issues **deemed relevant** in broader Stacks ecosystem or AdvoxDAO. Particularly issues that are picking up steam in dialogue from multiple parties in the channels.

**1 | Autonomous Clan Facilitation**

First, Wolf clan reps tag other clans as needed to tend to the issue. All three clans use the #active-issues channels as needed to deliberate the issue, each using autonomous processes. The bottom up quorum period of participation will need to be decided for consensus; real-time meetings for time zones and schedules will need to be initiated where possible or thread dialogue when not possible.

**2 | Autonomous Clan Prelims**

Two representatives, one female and one male, from each of the 3 clans, come to consensus in autonomous processes before moving to formal consensus, where dialogue will converge. This is critical to sustainability. Through the long term, complex dynamics of our ecosystem, it is ensured that the autonomous voices of women & ecosystems are not drowned out.

![clanflow.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/clanflow.jpg)

Throughout the Preliminary phase, there is communication between the 6 clan reps  (3 female and 3 male). This means the formal phase is virtually just a formalization of what has already been discussed in prelim phase consensus. A critical means for streamlining as many voices as possible while avoiding gridlock.

  

**We currently have no temporary representatives in place, so prelim phase facilitation leads will need to be determined by respective clans until we have selected our reps.**

This is a basic oversimplified use of the #activeissues channel tooling for respective clan consensus. The tooling is to be customized as need to suit the respective clan consensus flows.

## Formal Consensus

**3 | Streamlining the Autonomous Processes in Formal Consensus**

While 9 times out of 10 all positions brought to the floor have already been covered in prelims to easily be made official; this is the first time the female and males are sitting together in decision making. And deliberation is still possible in this formal phase in the rare case it is needed. And here we see a streamlining of autonomous processes, not just between female and male decision making but also between human systems & ecosystems. This is evident in the physical lay out & flow of the formal phase:

  

-   _Male Wolf Clan introduces the issues to the floor. If any needed deliberation, it happens between Bear & Wolf clans, while Turtles observe the deliberation and validate against core collective values, before passing through to be made official._

![clandeliberation.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/clandeliberation.jpg)
  

Both Wolf clans, female and male, sit with their backs to the North. Both Bear clans sit with their backs to the South. But the Female Turtle clan sit with their backs to the West and the Male Turtles with their backs to the East. So while the other clans‚Äô deliberation can occur easily between female & male because they are sitting next to each other, for Turtles to come to consensus on positions there has to be movement across the council floor. And this is a critical mechanism for both social organization resilience & ecological sustainability.

## Formal Consensus: Preservation of Autonomy

Below is a description of how preservation of autonomy in social organization & ecosystems is represented by the Female Turtles walking over to the male Turtles to reach consensus on positions. And how even in this digital space this functions as a critical means to streamlining resilient social consensus in general:

With the [traits of the clans](https://github.com/stx-advox/coc/blob/main/README.md#intro) in full function in decision making, the Turtle‚Äôs function here is a last nuance in a long flow of decision making protocols that decouples top down concentrated power, enabling autonomous innovation for generators of value, including our ecosystems.
